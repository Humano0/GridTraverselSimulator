# GridTraverselSimulator

  Grid Traversal Simulator is an interactive tool that showcases some of the most popular pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A*. This project lets users explore how these algorithms find the shortest paths in grid-based scenarios, like mazes and game maps.
